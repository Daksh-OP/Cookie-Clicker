# Cookie-Clicker
Cookie Clicker is an incremental game where the main goal is to bake as many cookies as possible. The player starts with a cookie counter that increases every time they click (or press a key). As more cookies are collected, the player can spend them on upgrades such as auto-clickers, multipliers, or other features that boost cookie production.
